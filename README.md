# Personal-Voice-Assistant
Personal Voice Assistant was inspired by Google Assistant and Siri. This is my personal JavaScript project based upon voice recognition besides many other projects such as Color changer and Season changer 

Personal Voice Assistant can easily integrate with any given website making it more accessible by adding voice driven use cases!!!.

This particular version of my voice AI can do Following set off commands:
1. search for weather 
2. search for any place/ city/ country/ planets.
3. search for famous people.
4. Surf google based upon voice input
5. assists in buying stuff from Amazon 
6. Can answer questions like how are you? ..
7. Show you the backside of how it is working based upon confidence level and what it interpreted. 
8. give answer in 19+ international languages.
9. translate words from one language to another
10. simple yet eye catching UI.
